        Hello my name is Zaria Diaz
    </h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my MEDPL 150 portfolio site!
    </p>
     <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
    <p> I am inspired by my life experiences and the abundance of inspiration in New York City. In my art, I hope to
        express my cultural experiences and reflect eventful moments in my life that shaped who I am today. Through
        various forms of media and expression, I want to translate themes like mental health, independence, social
        roles, and power. My works will include web design, digital vectors, illustration, and photography. </p>

    <p> As a psychology major, I have learned that art is a powerful way to encourage healing, alleviate stress, express complex feelings, and recover from grief. Art teaches the body and mind to connect to the soul, and this connection fosters the ability to create something. Art can also influence how we see the world and the people around us. In my works, I hope to give others a glimpse into what it means to be living in America as a woman of color, as a person who is disabled, and as a person who struggles with their mental health. In MEDPL 150, I wish to explore a wide range of creative expression and become both a better artist and consumer of art.
