        Hello my name is Zaria Diaz
    </h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my MEDPL 150 portfolio site!
    </p>
     <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
    <p> I am inspired by my life experiences and the abundance of inspiration in New York City. In my art, I hope to
        express my cultural experiences and reflect eventful moments in my life that shaped who I am today. Through
        various forms of media and expression, I want to translate themes like mental health, independence, social
        roles, and power. My works will include web design, digital vectors, illustration, and photography. </p>

    <p> As a psychology major, I have learned that art is a powerful way to encourage healing, alleviate stress, express complex feelings, and recover from grief. Art teaches the body and mind to connect to the soul, and this connection fosters the ability to create something. Art can also influence how we see the world and the people around us. In my works, I hope to give others a glimpse into what it means to be living in America as a woman of color, as a person who is disabled, and as a person who struggles with their mental health. In MEDPL 150, I wish to explore a wide range of creative expression and become both a better artist and consumer of art.

<h2> Reflection</h2>
    <p>Creating this web page induced a sense of nostalgia. It brought me back to when I was in high school during the pandemic and learning how to create websites in an online afterschool program. I made a lot of good memories doing this and it felt good to connect with people despite everything going on in the world. I started off a bit rusty as I didn’t remember some tag names and I was having trouble with my images. If you click the link to see my cats, they seem to be in danger of falling off the web page due to the image being rotated. I hope to fix this when we get to our CSS module. 
</p>
<p>
I am excited for what is to come in the next lab sessions and I hope to further build this website into something that reflects who I am.
