  <title>"In Plato's Cave" from <i>On Photography</i> by Susan Sontag</title>

    <p>
      According to "In Plato’s Cave" by Susan Sontag, “To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. 
      It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge – and, therefore, like power” (Sontag, 1). 
      When I capture images and create graphics, I try to depict something that resonates with me emotionally. 
      I often take images of things that I feel advocate for the beauty in this world, despite the ugliness and violence. 
      When I see something that makes me stop and think, “This makes life worth living,” I tend to take a picture of that thing. 
      Similar to Sontag’s work, capturing these uplifting subjects inspires a sense of power. I believe that it’s truly powerful, despite everything going on in the world, to still find beauty in it. 
      Preserving this beauty, by capturing a photo of it, allows it to become evidence in the case that maybe the world is not all so bad.

    <p>Another idea Sontag brings forward is the purposeful nature of photography. She illustrates this through the example of an anxious workaholic on vacation who uses 
      photography as a way to feel productive; giving themselves a defined task when they’re supposed to be “doing nothing” (3). I resonated deeply with this. 
      I’m also someone who feels uneasy when I don’t have a clear purpose; sometimes it feels like my hands should never be empty. 
      When I’m on vacation and expected to relax, I struggle to accept that stillness. I slip into the same role as the anxious workaholic, 
      taking photos as a way to justify my presence. If I’m not going to do anything, I might as well capture myself doing nothing, right?
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the most poignant idea that Sontag proposes is the controversy of capturing images of suffering. On one hand, photographing tragic events may strengthen our 
      collective conscience and our ability to be compassionate (5). On another, repeated viewings of these atrocities can lead to desensitization and avoidance.
